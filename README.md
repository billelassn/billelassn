## Welcome to my GitHub page 👋

🎓 I am an engineer with degrees from Mines Saint-Étienne and Université Paris Dauphine - PSL. Currently, I am specializing in AI for healthcare, pursuing a research master's degree in ST4H (Sciences and Technology for Health) at Université PSL.

💡 I have a strong interest in AI applied to healthcare, with a particular passion for generative AI, cheminformatics, and drug design. My goal is to use these technologies to create a meaningful impact in the healthcare sector.

🏆 I enjoy taking on data science challenges. You can check out my projects, including my participation in the PIK3CA mutation detection challenge with Owkin.

I'm always looking to explore new AI techniques and collaborate on impactful projects. Feel free to connect! 🌱
